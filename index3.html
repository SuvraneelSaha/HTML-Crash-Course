<!-- in websites we see navbar that is actually an unordered list 
styled in a way that is very presentable and is nice to look at 
they are styled in a inline manner so that all the list items come right 
after the previous ones  -->
<!-- ul stands for unordered list 
css is present by default like the shape of the bullet point or the padding left which is present .
If you wanna make sure that the shape needs to be different or the padding needs to be changed then that can be 
done by using css manually  -->
