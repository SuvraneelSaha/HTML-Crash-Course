 points : 
 we dont need a server or to host to view and create html files
 the file name can be anything just the extension needs to be .html in the end 
 the html files can run on a web browser

 the index.html is the root / home page of a website 

 if we go to a domain ex - www.something.com 
 the file will be shown on the root domain is the index.html file 


 about.html then www.something.com/about.html 

 by default whenever we go to a website the index.html file loads up as the base or root page
